# Rate Limits

## Overview

HTMLPix uses monthly render quotas rather than per-second rate limits. Your plan determines how many renders you can make per calendar month.

## Plan Limits

| Plan | Renders / Month |
|------|-----------------|
| Free | 50 |
| Starter | 1,000 |
| Pro | 3,000 |
| Scale | 10,000 |

## How Limits Work

- **Only successful renders count** toward your quota. Failed renders (4xx/5xx responses) do not consume any quota.
- **Usage resets** at the start of each calendar month at midnight UTC.
- **Check your current usage** anytime via the dashboard.

## Handling Quota Exceeded (429)

When you exceed your monthly quota, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response with the error code `QUOTA_EXCEEDED`:

```json
{
  "code": "QUOTA_EXCEEDED",
  "message": "Monthly quota of 1000 renders exceeded"
}
```

### What to do

- **Upgrade your plan** from the dashboard to immediately increase your quota.
- **Wait for the monthly reset** if you don't need additional renders right away. Your quota resets on the 1st of the next month at midnight UTC.

## Concurrent Requests

There is no hard per-second rate limit. However, very high burst traffic may be queued on the server side. For best results, limit concurrent requests to **10-20** at a time.

## Monitoring Usage

- **Dashboard** -- View real-time render counts and remaining quota on your dashboard.
- **Response header** -- Inspect the `X-Usage-Remaining` header on API responses to programmatically track how many renders you have left.
