# Authentication

All API requests require an API key. Include it in the `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer hpx_your_api_key
```

Get your API key from the [dashboard](/api-keys). Keep it secret - never expose it in client-side code.

## Security Best Practices

- Store API keys in environment variables
- Never commit keys to version control
- Rotate keys periodically
- Use separate keys for development and production
