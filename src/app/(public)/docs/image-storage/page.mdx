# Image Delivery

HTMLPix now serves OG images through signed URLs on `GET /v1/image`.

## Delivery model

1. Your backend mints a signed URL using `POST /v1/image-url`.
2. You publish the signed URL in OG tags.
3. Crawlers request `GET /v1/image` and receive binary image bytes.
4. Cloudflare caches by full query string.

## Why this model

- API keys stay private.
- URLs are crawler-safe.
- Deterministic query URLs are CDN-friendly.
- Cache hits are served without re-rendering.

## Headers

Successful image responses include:

- `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
- `ETag`
- `X-Render-Cached`

## Notes

- Signed URLs are long-lived by default.
- If you rotate templates, mint fresh URLs (new `tv`) to invalidate cache.
