## Competitor Deep Dives

### 1. htmlcsstoimage.com (HCTI) — Primary Direct Competitor

**Domain advantage:** Exact-match domain "html css to image" gives massive keyword authority.

**Site structure:**
- ~60 pages total
- Docs subdomain (docs.htmlcsstoimage.com) with 50+ pages
- 10 language code examples (C#, cURL, Go, Google Apps Script, JS, PHP, Python, Ruby, TS, VB.NET)
- 3 use case pages (Social Cards, Screenshots, Dynamic Images)
- 3 integration pages (Zapier, Make, MCP Server)
- No blog, no comparisons, no free tools

**Pricing:** Free (50/mo), Starter ($14/1K), Growth ($30/5K), Enterprise ($3K/1M)

**Strengths:**
- Domain name SEO moat
- First-mover in exact "html css to image" keyword
- AlternativeTo, G2, Product Hunt all list them as the category leader
- 10 language examples (more than most)

**Weaknesses:**
- No blog — zero thought leadership content
- No comparison pages — not defending against alternatives
- No free tools — no top-of-funnel acquisition
- Higher pricing than HTMLPix ($14 vs $8 for similar tier)
- Docs on subdomain (subdomains don't pass authority to main domain as effectively)
- Stale — limited recent content updates

**How HTMLPix can win against HCTI:**
1. Price: $8 vs $14 for 1K renders
2. Content: Build what they don't have (blog, comparisons, tools)
3. Templates: Public gallery they can't match
4. Create `/alternative/htmlcsstoimage` page targeting "[hcti] alternative"

## Key Takeaways

1. **HCTI owns the keyword but not the content.** Their domain name is their moat. We can't beat them on domain name, but we can out-content them.

2. **ScreenshotOne shows pSEO works.** Their 43 use case pages prove that templated pages with niche keywords drive traffic in this space.

3. **Urlbox shows volume works.** 150+ blog posts covering every possible angle. We don't need 150, but we need consistent publishing.

4. **Pictify shows free tools convert.** Their 6 tools are the most innovative acquisition strategy in the space.

5. **The gap is clear:** Nobody has ALL of: free tools + template gallery + comparison pages + blog + use case pages + language SDKs. HTMLPix can be the first to have a complete content strategy.
