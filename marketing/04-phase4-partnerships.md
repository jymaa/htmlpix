# Phase 4: Partnerships & Growth Loops (Month 5-7) — $0-200/mo

Leverage other people's audiences and platforms.

---

## 1. Integration Partners

### Strategy: Build Integrations That Market Themselves

Every integration = a new audience + a backlink + a keyword opportunity.

**Psychology:**
- **Network Effects:** Each integration makes HTMLPix more valuable
- **Switching Costs:** Deep integrations make switching away harder
- **Authority Bias:** "Works with [trusted brand]" transfers credibility

### Priority Integrations

| Partner | Integration | Marketing Benefit |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **Zapier** | HTMLPix trigger/action | Listed on Zapier marketplace (DA 90+), "zapier html to image" keyword |
| **Make (Integromat)** | HTMLPix module | Listed on Make marketplace, reaches no-code audience |
| **n8n** | HTMLPix node | Open source community, GitHub stars |
| **Vercel** | Example project | Vercel templates marketplace, huge Next.js audience |
| **Supabase** | Example project | "Generate OG images from Supabase data" tutorial |
| **Convex** | Already integrated | Co-marketing opportunity (you use their stack) |
| **Resend** | Example: email images | "Dynamic email images" use case |

### For Each Integration

1. Build the integration/connector
2. Create a tutorial page (`/docs/integrations/zapier`)
3. Get listed on their marketplace/directory
4. Write a co-marketing blog post
5. Share on their community channels

### Approach Script (for reaching out)

> Hey [Name], I built HTMLPix — an HTML-to-image API. I just published an integration with [Platform] and a tutorial showing how to use [Platform] + HTMLPix for [use case]. Would you be open to featuring it in your [marketplace/community/blog]? Here's the tutorial: [link]

Lead with what you've already built. Don't ask for permission — ship the integration first.

## 2. Framework-Specific Content Partnerships

### Vercel / Next.js

**Opportunity:** Next.js developers are the #1 audience for OG image generation. @vercel/og has limitations (no full CSS, limited fonts). HTMLPix solves this.

**Actions:**
- Build a Next.js starter template: `create-next-app` with HTMLPix OG images
- Submit to Vercel's templates marketplace
- Write: "Beyond @vercel/og: Full CSS OG Images in Next.js with HTMLPix"
- Engage in Next.js Discord when people ask about OG images

### Astro

**Opportunity:** Astro's community is growing fast. No built-in image generation.

**Actions:**
- Create `astro-htmlpix` integration package
- Submit to Astro integrations directory
- Write tutorial for Astro blog/community

### SvelteKit, Nuxt, Remix

Same pattern: build integration → document → submit to ecosystem → engage in community.

## 3. Affiliate / Referral Program (Month 6)

### Structure

```
Refer a paying customer → get 20% of their first 3 months
Customer gets: 100 extra free renders for signing up via referral
```

### Why 20% Revenue Share Works

**Psychology:**
- **Reciprocity:** Generous share makes affiliates feel valued
- **Loss Aversion:** "You're missing out on referral income" for developers who already recommend APIs
- **Commitment & Consistency:** Once someone refers one person, they're more likely to keep referring

### Who to Target as Affiliates

1. **Developer bloggers** who write about tools/APIs
2. **YouTube creators** making web dev tutorials
3. **Course creators** teaching web development
4. **Newsletter authors** covering developer tools
5. **Indie hackers** who build in public

### Affiliate Assets to Provide

- Unique referral links with tracking
- Pre-written copy snippets
- Banner images (generated by HTMLPix, obviously)
- Comparison table graphics
- Monthly performance dashboard

## 4. Co-Marketing with Complementary Tools (Month 5-6)

### Identify Non-Competing Tools with Overlapping Audience

| Tool | Overlap | Co-Marketing Idea |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Resend** (email API) | "Dynamic email images" | Joint blog post: "Personalized Email Images at Scale" |
| **Novu** (notification infra) | "Rich notification images" | Joint tutorial |
| **Stripe** | Invoice images | "Generate PDF-like invoice images from Stripe data" |
| **Sanity/Contentful** (CMS) | OG images from CMS content | "Auto-generate OG images from your CMS" |
| **Upstash** (serverless Redis) | Caching rendered images | "Cache rendered images with Upstash" |
| **Convex** | Already using it | "How HTMLPix uses Convex for real-time quota management" |

### Co-Marketing Format

1. **Joint blog post** — each publishes on their blog, linking to the other
2. **Joint webinar/livestream** — combined audiences
3. **Template/starter project** — uses both tools together
4. **Social cross-promotion** — share each other's content

**Psychology:**
- **Authority Bias:** Association with trusted brands transfers credibility
- **Mere Exposure:** New audience sees HTMLPix through a trusted source
- **Network Effects:** Integrations create dependency that strengthens both products

## 5. Developer Newsletter Sponsorships (Month 6-7) — $100-200/mo

Before going full paid ads, test with developer newsletter sponsorships. These are:
- Highly targeted (developer audience)
- Affordable ($50-200 per placement)
- Trusted (newsletter readers trust their curator)

### Target Newsletters

| Newsletter | Audience | Est. Cost | Relevance |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| **TLDR** | 1M+ developers | $100-300 | High |
| **Bytes.dev** | 200K+ JS devs | $100-200 | Very High |
| **This Week in React** | 50K+ React devs | $50-100 | Very High |
| **Python Weekly** | 200K+ Python devs | $100-200 | High |
| **Changelog** | 500K+ developers | $200-500 | High |
| **Console.dev** | DevTools audience | $100-200 | Very High |
| **Hacker Newsletter** | HN audience | $100-200 | High |

### Newsletter Ad Copy

```
[HTMLPix — HTML to Image API]
Convert HTML/CSS to PNG, JPG, or WebP with one POST request.
Replace self-hosted Puppeteer in 5 minutes. 50 free renders/month.
→ htmlpix.com
```

Short. Direct. Developer-friendly. No hype.

---

## 6. Webinar / Livestream Content (Month 6-7)

### Topics That Work

- "Building an OG Image Pipeline for Your Blog (Live Coding)"
- "HTML-to-Image in 2026: Tools, Techniques, and Tradeoffs"
- "From Puppeteer Hell to API Freedom: A Migration Story"

### Platforms

- YouTube Live → becomes evergreen content
- Twitter/X Spaces → reaches developer audience
- Twitch (coding category) → niche but engaged

**Psychology:**
- **Authority Bias:** Live demonstration = proof of expertise
- **Commitment & Consistency:** People who watch a 30-min livestream are highly invested
- **IKEA Effect:** Live coding along = they build something with your tool = ownership

## Phase 4 Expected Outcomes

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Indexed pages | 150+ |
| Backlinks (domains) | 40-60 |
| Organic traffic (monthly) | 3,000-8,000 |
| Referral traffic (monthly) | 500-1,500 |
| Keywords ranking (top 10) | 15-25 |
| Email subscribers | 300-700 |
| Signups | 100-250/month |
| Paid conversions | 15-40/month |
| MRR | $300-800 |
| Active affiliates | 5-15 |

## Key Insight

Partnerships amplify everything. A blog post shared on your own channels reaches hundreds. The same post co-published with a partner, shared in their community, listed on their marketplace? Thousands. The content moat from Phase 2 + the distribution network from Phase 4 = compounding growth.
